Mass YouTube Content Downloader (MYCD) is an automation script created by Carlos Oliveira (GitHub: @CarlossOliveira) based on yt-dlp.
This script is designed to automate the process of downloading large quantities of content from YouTube.
This documentation provides a brief explanation of all the program's features and parameters.
If you have any questions or issues, please contact the script's developer.

=> USER MANUAL AND IMPORTANT NOTES:
1- Both the search_matching and words_to_reject_during_search fields are optional filters. If you leave one or both 
   blank, the program will run without any problems but won't filter the YouTube search.
2- The number_of_search_queries field tells the program to check the first x entries of a search and decide which one to 
   choose. If you want to use filters, such as search_matching and words_to_reject_during_search, you will likely benefit 
   from selecting a wider range of search results. However, if you don't use filters, 1 or 2 entries might suffice.If you 
   are using the search mode, it is mandatory to specify at least 1 entry for the program to work.
3- All fields except search_matching and words_to_reject_during_search are mandatory. If you leave one blank, the program 
   won't run or will malfunction.
4- Both yt-dlp and ffmpeg need to be installed. By default, the folder containing this program will also have a sub-folder 
   called "Program Files". This folder contains a Windows version of yt-dlp and ffmpeg. The program will use those executables 
   by default. If you prefer to use your own paths, specify them below in the "PATH CONFIGURATION" section in their designated 
   fields. If you don't wish to use your own versions, leave those fields empty so the program will use the default executables.
5- The input file must be a .txt file for the program to work. The input files require a specific format for the program to 
   read them.
6- If you are using the search mode, your input text file should look like example (1).
7- If you are using the link mode, your input text file should look like example (2).
8- The character § should only be used to specify the duration of a search. It should not be used for any other purpose.
9- The §[EXPECTED_VIDEO_DURATION]§ field is OPTIONAL. If you specify the intended duration of the video/music to download, 
   the program will apply a filter to the search, selecting only matches that are of equal or shorter duration. If you don't 
   wish to use this filter, simply omit it. The duration format should follow the following structure: §[MINUTES:SECONDS]§
10- The best_video_quality format is an option to output the best video quality possible. The format may vary from video to video, 
    but choosing this option will always ensure the best resolution and sound available.
11- The filters in the search_matching and words_to_reject_during_search fields should be separated by a "|" to be applied correctly.
12- Under the "PATH CONFIGURATION," you can find a field called output_folder_path. This field is reserved for specifying where you 
    want to store the output folder of the program (MD - MASS DOWNLOADER (Output Folder)). If you want to use this feature, you should 
    indicate your desired path. If you don't want to use this feature, leave it blank, and the program will create the folder in the 
    directory where it is being executed.
13- The only fields that can be used in the program if the operation mode is set to link are: operation_mode, output_format, 
    output_folder_path, yt_dlp_path and ffmpeg_path. 
14- If you are using the link mode, the program will automatically verify if between the links there are any that are from a playlist 
    and will download them using other methods of download. The title of each video downloaded via this mode will temporarily be of the 
    following format: [PLAYLIST_INDEX_NUMBER] TITLE.FILE_FORMAT
15- If a playlist is detected, following the download of all its tracks, the program will prompt you to verify and identify any missing 
    tracks or errors.
16- Some cookie or identity verification errors may occur during the download process. It is recommended that tracks which could not be 
    downloaded due to these errors are manually downloaded using the yt-dlp program. However, under the Configuration and User Input 
    section in the script code, there are two options you can tweak to possibly enable the script to download those tracks. For more 
    information about this issue, you should refer to the yt-dlp documentation or contact the program developer.
17- If you start experiencing multiple HTTP errors with the code 403, or errors containing the message "Access Denied," your computer 
    may have been flagged by YouTube servers due to a high download rate. This action will prevent you from downloading content from 
    YouTube for a certain period of time. To avoid this from happening, you can toggle the variable named boat_uncovered from False 
    to True to enable privacy-enhancing mechanisms that may help address the issue. However, while this option may resolve the problem, 
    enabling it will decrease the download rate, significantly affecting the script's performance. It is recommended to use a VPN or a 
    proxy every time you run this script to avoid receiving an IP ban from YouTube.

For more information or to report any bugs, feel free to contact the developer and/or reach out to yt-dlp support on GitHub.
